    <h3>A homemade beef jerky marinade made with soy sauce, liquid smoke, brown sugar, and spices makes the most flavorful beef jerky ever! I have been making jerky for years and I concocted this recipe by trial and error. </h3>
    <p>Everyone says it is the best jerky they've ever had! My dehydrator is designed for jerky and takes about 4 hours to dry the meat. This could also be done in the oven or using other dehydrators, just check your manual for correct times as each machine is different. I hope you enjoy this jerky as much as my family and I do. Store in an airtight container or resealable bags.</p>
